    <br>
    <p>To request any Collected Data (any data that Virtual Waifu across Discord, Revolt or Crispy-Chat may have collected) collected by The Application (Virtual Waifu on either Discord, Revolt or Crispy-Chat), you can send an email to The Developers of The Application via the official support email: <a href="mailto:tallerthanshort@duck.com">TallerThanShort@duck.com</a></p>
    <p>Remember to state your User ID/User UUID and Platform, otherwise your request will be nullified (archived and not responded to). We keep Discord, Revolt and Crispy-Chat data collections separate, so you will need to file an individual request for each.</p>

    <p><a href="mailto:tallerthanshort@duck.com">TallerThanShort@duck.com</a> is the <i>only</i> <b>official</b> support contact The Developers of The Application provide. If at any given point someone is attempting to impersonate us, please feel free to reach out with the following evidence:</p>

            <p>Sending an email that is <b>not</b> <a href="mailto:tallerthanshort@duck.com">TallerThanShort@duck.com</a>, an email that displays <a href="mailto:tallerthanshort@duck.com">TallerThanShort@duck.com</a> but sends the email to another address once clicked (hyperlink physhing or markdown formatting in general).</p>
            <li>Attempting to impersonate support</li>
            <p>Requesting that you contact a User account on any platform (Discord, Revolt, Crispy-Chat or other), or requesting you go to a website outside the <a href="https://virtualwaifubot.com">virtualwaifubot.com</a> domain.

            <li>Requesting you contact them for legal advice or legal help regarding The Application.</li>
            <p>This can be a User requesting you contact <i>them</i> or any other User regarding any legal issue regarding The Application, rather than redirecting you to contact <a href="mailto:tallerthanshort@duck.com">TallerThanShort@duck.com</a>.</p>
        </ul>
        <li>Platform Information</li>

    <h2>FAQ:</h2>
    <b>Q: How often can I request my data?</b>
    <p>A: You can request your data at any given time, without any limitations. We don't keep hardly any data, and furthermore, it's hashed by an automatic hashing algorithm.</p>
    <b>Q: What are the weird lines under "infractions"?</b>
    <p>A: These are Infraction ID's. They are hashed UUID's that The Application understands as your Infraction ID.</p>
    <b>Q: Why is my ID/UUID innacurate?</b>
    <p>A: We don't store any raw data. Your ID/UUID is hashed in an automatic hashing algorithm, along with all the data stored within.</p>
    <b>Q: Why is the file blank?</b>
    <p>A: We don't collect hardly any data. Only Users with Infractions (warnings) really have any Collected Data.</p>
    <b>Q: How do I request my Guild's/Server's data?</b>
    <p>A: You can request your Guild/Server data at any given time, without any limitations. You will most likely have a blank file, as we only store hashed ID's/UUID's of Guild's/Server's The Application is banned from by The Developers, along with a boolean (True/False status).</p>
